# Traffic
Description: Java Swing GUI that displays in real time traffic light for three major road Intersections. The current time stamps in 1 second interval, in the X and Y position, and speed for up 3 cars as they traverse through the three major intersections. 

User's Guide:
Assuming the user knows how to execute JavaScript in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Eclipse or NetBeans, this program is quite simple to run. When starting this program, it will immediately display the JOptionPane.showInputDialog for the user to input the amount of up to three cars. Then, it creates a GUI dashboard of a traffic simulation tracker and its real-time simulation. The dashboard will display the traffic light sign of three intersections (A, B, C) and the cars moving when the user presses the “start” button. The traffic lights from the three intersections will be changing from green, yellow, and red infinitely until the user presses the buttons to pause “suspended” or stop “interrupting” the threads as the sliders represent each car moving. It always displays the same table data list. However, the user will notice that a movement occurs only in the entry of vehicles (sliders) and all the intersections. For instance, if the user has entered a “1” vehicle, it will display moving only one car (X-Pos and Speed Km/h) while the others remain stationary; Likewise, they are traveling a straight line, so we assume that Y=0 position. The speed of each car is set as 180Km/h. The “yellow” and “red” light will remain so for 5 seconds, while the “green” light will be for 10 seconds. If the car xPosition is within 500 meters and the light is “red,” it sets to suspend, making the car wait (as on dime). There is a loop through the simulation buttons providing the user the ability to start, pause, continue, and stop. The program was not built to resume or restart after clicking the “Stop” button. Therefore, if the user clicks the “stop” button, it counts three to one to stop the threads and lock the panel. Afterward, the user must manually close the program to start the simulation again.
